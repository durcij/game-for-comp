# Game for Comp

This is where I'll be storing files for my comprehensive project at Allegheny College.  It's still unnamed, but I'll at least begin storing the files now.

## Characters

There are 8 playable characters planned, at this moment.  Every character is based on an emotion, and is colored to match that emotion in some way.  Each character also has a unique skill or passive ability.
