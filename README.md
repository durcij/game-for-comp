# Game for Comp

This is where I'll be storing files for my comprehensive project at Allegheny College.  It's still unnamed, but I'll at least begin storing the files now.

## Characters

There are 8 playable characters planned, at this moment.  Every character is based on an emotion, and is colored to match that emotion in some way.  Each character also has a unique skill or passive ability.

### Character List and Powers

Character | Emotion | Ability
--------- | ------- | -------
Risio | Happiness | Can run more quickly than other characters
Furia | Rage | Has a longer attack reach than other characters
Tristitia | Sadness | Can slide on her tears to dash
Dormio | Exhaustion | Loses less treasure when attacked
Dilectio | Love | Gains treasure while near others, loses it while far from them
Verecundia | Anxiety | Gains treasure while far from others, loses it while near them
Invidia | Jealousy | Knocks more treasure from other players
Mercuria | Luck | Has a chance to dodge an attack

## Planned Research Idea

My goal is to research how people interact while playing different styles of games through local multiplayer.  I'm specifically looking to study how people interact in competitive and cooperative play.  To do this, I'm building a game that can be played either competitively, or cooperatively, and giving instructions that give differing ideas of what to do in the game.

### Differing instructions

#### Competitive

In the competitive group, I plan to suggest competitive play by saying that players will be playing "against" each other to get as high of a score as possible.  I'll also further suggest competitive play by putting two treasure containing dummies that look like player characters into the spawns of competitive players.

#### Cooperative

In the cooperative group, I plan to suggest cooperative play by saying that players will be playing "with" each other to get as high of a score as possible.  I'll also further suggest cooperative play by putting two treasure containing dummies that look like non-player characters into the spawns of cooperative players.

#### Control

In the control group, I plan to suggest neither cooperative nor competitive play by simply saying that players will be playing a multiplayer game with a scoring system based on treasure.  I'll also further hold the control by putting two treasure containing dummies into the spawns of control players, one that looks like a player character, and one that looks like a non-player character.

### Data Recording and Analysis

To record the data, I plan to use a screen recording software of some sort (most likely [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)) as well as using a camera to record the interactions between players during their play session.

I will then analyze this footage to gain an idea of what players did to communicate, the ways people played and the characters they chose based on the instructions given prior, and the strategies they employed in the game.

### Goal

My goal in this project is to both gain further understanding of human communication while playing local multiplayer games, and to build an engaging local multiplayer gaming experience.  I've always valued local multiplayer above online multiplayer, and I think this would be an area in which I could spend countless hours on research, design, and personal time.
